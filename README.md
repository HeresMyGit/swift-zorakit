# ZoraKit

This package makes it easy to use the ZoraAPI in Swift projects.

## Why?

The Zora API [https://api.zora.co](https://api.zora.co) is a GraphQL endpoint that provides rich information about NFTs.

While you can totally bring in something like Apollo and just make GraphQL queries yourself, there's a bit of ceremony to set that up.

With ZoraKit, you can use the Zora API in your Swift and SwiftUI projects in a way that feels more native to the platform.

## Using it

## Running the example

- Open the ZoraKit.xcworkspace.
- Run the example app.
